# Regeneration prompt: `docs/GITHUB-SETTINGS.md`

You are generating **only** `docs/GITHUB-SETTINGS.md` for the `gha-emergency-kit` repository.

## Repository mission
A shareable emergency toolkit for pausing a runaway GitHub Actions situation, converting workflows to manual-only mode, and verifying each workflow deliberately.

## Target requirements
Map every relevant GitHub UI and YAML control with exact paths, including which controls do not address run frequency.

## Non-negotiable constraints
- Write direct, technical documentation or readable Bash/Python code as appropriate.
- Explain limits instead of promising a universal or permanent fix.
- Code must be copy-pasteable, deterministic, and safe to run twice where practical.
- Shell scripts that call the GitHub API use `set -uo pipefail`, never `set -e`.
- YAML-editing code must never modify anything outside `.github/workflows/`.
- Do not include telemetry, credentials, or unrelated dependencies.
- Return the complete content of the target file and nothing else.
